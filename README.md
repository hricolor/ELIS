# EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications (ELIS)

## ELIS repository
The ELIS repository has been set up for the public distribution of the EIRA Library of Interoperability Specifications (ELIS). 

The ELIS provides a set of interoperability specifications that define the different interoperability aspects of European public services. 

ELIS is expressed as an electronic catalogue so it can be consumed by software applications like ArchiÂ® and other architecture modelling and development tools. For its expression as a machine-readable artefact, the ELIS uses the DCAT-AP specification.
